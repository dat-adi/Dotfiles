#+TITLE: Literate Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Datta Adithya
#+PROPERTY: :tangle config.el

* Defaults
Identification can be done by setting some global variables to identify the person.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "G V Datta Adithya"
      user-mail-address "dat.adithya@gmail.com")
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)
#+end_src

* Theme
I particularly like the default DOOM One theme that has been set up by =hlissner=, and as such, I'll leave the doom-theme, as is.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
#+end_src

* Org Mode
A few settings to initialize and configure =org-mode= for Emacs.
This mostly setting up the directory to look into, and the deadline warning days and the such.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-files (quote("~/Documents/org/tasks.org"
                              "~/Documents/org/meetings.org"))
      org-deadline-warning-days 7
      org-directory "~/Documents/org/")
#+end_src

* Elfeed
I need to set up an RSS reader for feeds that I wish to follow, so, here's some configuration that I need to go through in order to do so.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq elfeed-feeds
      '("https://news.ycombinator.com/rss"))
#+end_src
