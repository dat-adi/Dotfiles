# Config Notes
A repository to contain the configuration files of my editors, and settings of the IDEs as well. Maybe a bit more.

It really only just contains my configurations of my .vimrc, and maybe I'll add in my emacs config once I get the hang of it as well.

I've converted to Arch Linux.

I've connected bunch of my files required for my configuration into this repository.
At this point, the config consists of a large number of applications, and software, ranging from fish to vim, to tmux, to qtile, to DOOM Emacs.

I can probably say that it wouldn't be too much of a hassle to get my setup back, on a new computer of Arch Linux, with a simple git pull and configure using symlinks at this point.

Discovered [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot#getting-started).
My setup only continues to be easier to set up.

At this point, all I need to do in order to set myself back up, would be a simple few lines.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:dat-adi/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install
```

That's it!
Just three lines to get back a setup worth of config files, efficiency!
